## Description
I love to play basketball recreationally, not only because it keeps me in shape, but also due to the opportunity it presents to develop and forge lasting relationships. But, no matter what basketball gym I play in, there are always issues with the order of which players/teams are set to play.

 Some gyms have a signup list in which the players sign their names, but it never fails that someone’s name is scratched off, someone signs their name in multiple spots, the list comes up missing altogether, or there are multiple lists circulating within the gym. Other gyms seem to go by the honor system and rely on the players themselves to keep up with the order of games and teams. There seems to always be a person that causes problems no matter what the system is. 
 
 The “I Got Next!” app provides a solution to the issue.  The easy to use app displays the teams, in order, of which games will be played; making it easy for users to know when they will play and who they will be playing with.

The users will have access to the app via the gym kiosk/iPad where they will create the teams and view the order of when the games will be played. Upon visiting the app the user will be able to view the available players by clicking the `Available Players` link within the navbar.

After viewing the available players, the user can navigate back to the home page by clicking `Home` link or the logo within the navbar. Once back to the homepage, the user will click the `We have our Team` button which will take the user to a form.

When the user sees the `Create Your New Team` form, there is an input to create a team name and dropdown menus to select the team of five. The user will click the save button to create the new.

The new team will print to the `Teams` page where the user can review the team by clicking the "View Team" button.

Once within the Single Team View and the user's team is assemble and ready to commit, the `Add to Waitlist` button will  be selected to add to the "Waitlist" and will be sorted by the time the team was added - the newest addition will be at the bottom of the list.

The user can remove the team from the waitlist if anyone on the team becomes unavailable or if anyone on the team decides not to play with the particular team - the button is within the Single Team View
